# **Cinnamon roll**🍰

## **Ingredients**

- 2     tablespoons vegan butter, to coat the foil pan

**DOUGH**

- 2 cups     almond milk(480 mL), at room temperature
- ½ cup vegan butter(115 g), melted
- ¼ cup organic sugar(50 g)
- 1 packet active dry yeast
- 5 ½ cups flour(690 g), divided
- 1 teaspoon salt

**FILLING**

- ¾ cup vegan butter(170 g)
- ¾ cup brown sugar(165 g)
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

**ICING**

- 1 cup powdered sugar(160 g)
- 2 tablespoons almond milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

**Preparation**

1. Generously     rub two disposable foil pie pans with vegan butter.
2. In a     large bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted butter, and sugar. The     mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (37-43˚C). If it is hotter, allow to cool slightly.
3. Sprinkle     the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let set for 1 minute.
4. Add 5     cups flour and 1 teaspoon of salt to the milk mixture and mix with a     wooden spoon until just combined.
5. Cover     the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for     1 hour.
6. Preheat     oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
7. After 1     hour, the dough should have nearly doubled in size.
8. Remove     the towel and add an additional ½ cup (95g) of flour and salt. Stir well,     then turn out onto a well-floured surface.
9. Knead     the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough     just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface.
10. Roll     the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix     corners to make sure they are sharp and even.
11. Spread     the softened vegan butter evenly over the dough.
12. Sprinkle     evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon.
13. Roll up     the dough, forming a log, and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down.     Trim off any unevenness on either end.
14. Cut the     log in half, then divide each half into 7 evenly sized pieces. About 1½ inches (8 cm) thick each.
15. Place 7     cinnamon rolls in each cake pan, one in the center, six around the sides.     Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.
16. To     prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together     powdered sugar, almond milk, and vanilla until smooth.
17. Remove     plastic wrap. Bake the cinnamon rolls in a preheated oven at 350˚F (180˚C)     for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.
18. While     still warm, drizzle evenly with frosting.
19. Enjoy!
